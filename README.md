### Summary
Our goal was to visualize real historical sales data to provide new and quanitative insights for business operators. We looked at three business metrics (net sales, total item sales & averaged transaction amount) from nine business units. The locations varied in size and purpose (cafes, quick & full-service restaurants, convenience stores and a post office. The university has a very cyclical business pattern but it affects different businesses in different ways. We hoped to present the data in diffent ways to understand the business impact based on key moments in the academic schedule. As a bonus we added a weather data element, to eventually evaluate the impact of weather on sales.

### Dataset
 - Sales data was extracted from the university database. All Data is confidential and for educational purposes. Length of data - 4 years (some locations omitted).
 - Weather data extract from RIC Airport weather station (NOAA)
